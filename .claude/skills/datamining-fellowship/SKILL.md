# Datamining Fellowship

The general method is the `datamining-unreal-builds` skill. The asset-level data model, the tag join
and the export contract are `extracting-fellowship-data`. This skill is what the method resolves to in
this build, and what has already been recovered so nobody pays for it twice.

**The failure this prevents:** fitting a formula to screenshots. It cost a full session here. Three
independent mistakes cancelled to within 1 per cent on ratings and 12 per cent on Stamina, so only one
was visible, and the visible one looked like a missing mechanic rather than a wrong formula. The answer
was four instructions in the binary.

## The ladder, resolved for this build

| Rung | Where | What it gives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Already done? | `output/export-<build>/entities.jsonl` | Whether the value is already projected onto a document. This is the **output** of extraction, not a view of the build: it answers "does the export carry this entity's cast time", never "what fields does `DA_StatCalculationSettings` ship". A miss here means keep going, not that the asset lacks it. |
| 1. Schema | `UsmapParser` on `mappings/fellowship-<build>.usmap` | The **complete** input set of a system. `CRDynamicItemSettings` enumerates eight things and there is no ninth. Do this before searching the asset tree; it is what tells you when to stop. |
| 2. Config and assets | a reader under `src/FellowshipExtractor/Extraction/` | `ProviderFactory.CreateAsync` mounts the containers; `AssetRegistry.ReadAssets` is the index and `provider.LoadPackageObject<T>` reads a package. `.ini` files are container files like any other. Read rows, never file names. |
| 3. Binary | see below | Everything the first three do not carry. |

What the config already gave up, so nobody reads it twice:
`[/Script/fellowship.CRItemSettings]` in `DefaultGame.ini` holds `StatPoolCalculation`,
`ItemLevelsPerUpgrade`, `MaxItemLevel`, the tempering **cost** mods, `GemSocketPowerMultipliers`,
`ItemGemPowers` and, as of build 24952830, all fourteen fields of `HeroItemPowerPotentialSettings`.
`ItemSettings.cs` reads that section; `ConfigIni.cs` is the paren-depth-aware literal parser it needs,
because `ScorePerGemType=((Tier1, 20),…)` sits inside the `HeroItemPowerPotentialSettings=(…)` struct
and a split on commas shreds it. Map keys are enum **member names**, checked against the usmap enum
tables (`ECRGemTier`, `ECRGemSocketTier`, `ECRHeroItemType`) rather than trusted as text.
`[/Script/fellowship.CRItemStaticDataSubsystem]` names `DT_SlotWeights`, `DT_AttributeProperties`,
`DT_HeroItems` and the drop curves. `DynamicLootSystem.ini` names the loot plugin's seven assets.

The extractor ships no inspection commands: the only command is `usmap`, and a bare run writes the
export. Looking at a raw asset, a locres table, the CSV tuning tables or the Blueprint function index
means writing the reader that needs them, which is a standing approval under `CLAUDE.md`. The CSV
tables are already parsed in memory by `CsvTables.ReadTags` and `CsvTables.ReadConstants`.

## Reading the shipping binary

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fellowship\fellowship\Binaries\Win64\fellowship-Win64-Shipping.exe`,
177 MB, stripped, one monolithic image. **Static parsing only. Never launch the game, attach a
debugger, or go near EasyAntiCheat.**

`src/FellowshipExtractor/Usmap/PeImage.cs` already maps sections and virtual addresses and
`ReflectionScanner.cs` walks property registration records, so a harness is those two plus
`#:package Iced@1.21.0` in a file-based app: disassemble at a VA, and find cross references to a VA.

The anchor chain: UTF-16 literal in `.rdata`, the `lea` referencing it inside an `FName` constructor
stub, the sole reader of that `FName` global, then that thunk's callers. You are now inside the routine
that resolved the function by name. For a field, take the offset from the reflection record and search
for loads at that displacement.

## Already recovered, do not redo

Every address below was decoded against the **24736527** shipping exe. The exe changed in 24952830, so
re-anchor from the name-literal chain before reusing one.

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Item stat magnitude, whole calculation | `UCRDynamicHeroItem` virtual at **0x1455D33F0**, vtable 0x148C8B230 slot +0x2D0 |
| The pools it really calls | natives `PrimaryStatPowerFromItemLevel` 0x1455D4050, `SecondaryStatPowerFromItemLevel` 0x1455D4190 |
| Tempering | `0x1455D3813 movd xmm1,[rax+30h]`, `cvtdq2ps`, `0x1455D381B addss`, gated by `0x1455D37EB cmp byte [r14],0` |
| Round half to even, 1e-8 snap | **0x1412922F0** |
| Armour, one ceil after the slot multiply | **0x14531AC8B** |
| `FCRHeroItemInstance` | Level 0x20, TimesUpgraded 0x30, MaxAllowedUpgrades 0x34, ItemRarity 0x38, DynamicSlots 0x40 |
| Dynamic slot, stride 0x18 | SlotType 0x00, ContentType 0x01, RerollableSlotIndex 0x04, ContentVariantData 0x08 |
| `ECRItemStat` ordinals | table at 0x148B176D0; Stamina 1, Strength 2, Intellect 3, Agility 4, Power 18 |

The formula and every in-game reading it reproduces are in `docs/item-stat-calibration.md`, implemented
in `StatRows`/`StatMagnitudes` and pinned by `GroundTruthTests`.

Decoded against **24952830**, written up in `docs/item-power-potential.md` and implemented in
`Fellowship.Codex/Models/ItemPower.cs`:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Item power potential, whole calculation | `UCRItemsBlueprintLibrary::CalculateItemPowerPotential` **0x145317B00** |
| Loadout Power Score, whole calculation | unnamed native **0x145349B70**, `powf(1.04, talentPoints)` at 0x145349F3B |
| Slot weight map build, keyed on row+0x08 | `0x145314782` / `0x145314795` |
| `ECRHeroItemDynamicSlotType`, the instance's slot | BaseItemFixed 0, DynamicFixed 1, **Rerollable 2** |
| `ECRHeroItemDynamicSlotContentType` | GemSocket **1**, SetBonus **2**, GrantedAbility **4**, TraitTree **5** |

The two numbers are different scoring rules and the loadout total is not the sum of the per-item
function, so never call the per-item one to mean an item's contribution to a Power Score.

All ten terms of the per-item body are confirmed against printed cards, and both `ItemType` gates are
confirmed by a card that carries a gated slot and scores nothing for it. When a card's arithmetic could
split two ways because two factors share a value, read the rung's `rarityAdditions` row rather than
counting the card's coloured stat lines.

**Two enums differ only in word order and only one is the instance's.** `CRHeroItemDynamicSlot.SlotType`
is `ECRHeroItemDynamicSlotType`; `CRDynamicHeroItemSlotDefinition.SlotType` is
`ECRDynamicHeroItemSlotType`, whose members are entirely different. Reading an instance byte against the
definition enum turns Rerollable into RandomStat and silently misprices every item. Resolve an ordinal
through the struct that holds it, never through the enum whose name reads closest.

## Traps this build sets

**An omitted asset field is a live C++ constructor default, not zero.** `DA_StatCalculationSettings`
ships three of eight fields per block; the rest are real values: `PrimaryWeight` 0.25,
`SecondaryWeight` 0.3, `StaminaWeight` 0.5, `PrimaryMultiplier` 0.7, `WeightMultiplier` 0.15,
`StaminaMultiplierItemLevelThreshold` 315, and `SecondaryMultiplier` 0.6 on the base block, 1.5 on the
fixed block. They live in `StatRows` because no shipped file carries them. `SecondaryBaseMultiplier` is
72 and `PrimaryDivisible` is 15 the same way.

**A Blueprint function can be named right, wired through config, and never called.**
`HeroItemStatCalculation`'s `CalcPrimaryStatPoolFromItemLevel` is wired via
`CRItemSettings.StatPoolCalculation` and the magnitude path calls the two natives instead. Index the
Blueprint functions yourself before believing one: if no Blueprint function computes your number, it
is native.

**A parser that raises no exception has told you nothing.** Cooked packages degrade silently. Verify
values, never the absence of errors.

**Screenshot annotations are reconstructions.** Only the printed total is observed. Two readings
recorded as "declared plus one roll" were declared plus two, and one recorded as carrying a roll
carried none. Let the recovered formula tell you the split.

## Known unreachable

Native C++ bodies called from Blueprint bytecode are visible as a call with its arguments, never as
what the callee computes.

**Re-test a "no `.ini` sets it" claim against the build in front of you.** For 24736527 the record here
said `HeroItemPowerPotentialSettings` was fourteen compiled-in defaults; 24952830's `DefaultGame.ini`
writes all fourteen. The schema was byte-identical across the two builds, so nothing in the mappings
signalled the change — only re-reading the config did.

## Stop fitting when

- Every input the schema enumerates is read and a residual remains. The residual is code.
- The runtime struct carries the inputs but not the output. `CRHeroItemInstance` stores level, rarity,
  `TimesUpgraded` and slots and no magnitudes, so the client computes the printed number.

## Delegating it

Anchor strategies are independent, so this parallelises. One agent builds the harness while others
chase anchors; one lead each, told plainly that a dead end is an acceptable answer and that guessing a
formula from the observed numbers would corrupt the evidence; then adversarial verification on separate
lenses, with a fidelity lens that re-decodes every cited address rather than trusting the summary. Here
the refutation lens found a gate the synthesis missed and the fidelity lens found a double rounding in
the port. Neither surfaced from a single pass.

## Red flags

"One more screenshot would settle it." "It fits every reading I have." "That field is absent, so it is
zero." "The function is named for exactly this." "It is native, so it is unreachable."

Every one means: go back to rung 2, and if the schema is exhausted, disassemble.
